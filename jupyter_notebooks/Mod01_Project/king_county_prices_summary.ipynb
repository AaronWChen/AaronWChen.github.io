    "Our model, though not perfect, helps show the various factors that can affect house price in King County. Our root mean square error on that price is just over $130k for both the linear regression and through the lasso function meaning we can expect a variance in price to that amount when predicting a sale price for a home. By using data that takes into account data that spans more years, has more data from the more rural zipcodes for King County, and/or potentially grouping zipcodes into bins to help see the price based on an area versus arbitrary zipcodes may help make the model better.

    "Our approach to this model was to discover key variables that could help accurately determine sale price of a home in King County. Our first task was to see what sorts of questions we could answer to solve business problems with the raw data. Secondly, we cleaned the data, eliminated any features that did not help solve our business propositions and added any that gave better insight into what factors affected price. Once we had our initial model, we tweaked features to fit our model and proposed ways to augment the initial set of raw data. \n",

    "Our end goal was to minimize error, provide insights on what affected price, and develop a strategy around solving the business questions posed."
