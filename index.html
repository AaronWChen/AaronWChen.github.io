                <p>
                  MeaLeon uses machine learning and natural language processing to 
                  suggest new dishes! It takes in a user's dish and the cuisine 
                  it's from, looks in a static database, and returns 5 dishes with 
                  similar ingredients but different cuisines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The inspiration for MeaLeon has several combined origin stories. 
                  I once was making ground beef tacos and realized too late that I 
                  ran out of cumin. So, I grabbed the closest thing in my pantry
                  that was mostly cumin: garam masala. Suddenly, Tex-Mex tacos
                  turned into something more like roti. This reminded me of a friend
                  who hated sauerkraut and kim chi, and she quipped "every
                  culture has a disgusting fermented cabbage dish." Lastly, I can
                  get bored of my go to dishes and was seeking an easier way to 
                  create new dishes using mostly the same ingredients. These 
                  experiences and thoughts made me wish for something like MeaLeon
                  to exist.
                </p>

                  This solo project combines quite a few different technologies into
                  one full stack data science web app. The MVP is deployed on Heroku
                  via a Flask app and uses primarily Python 3, RESTful API,
                  HTML, and CSS. Improvements will incorporate web scraping, AWS 
                  services, MongoDB, classifier algorithms, and likely neural networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next steps would be to increase the number of recipes in the database
                  via scraping recipe sites from different cuisines, adding more cuisines
                  as classifier targets, and perform more advanced machine learning 
                  on unclassified recipes to further add recipes into the database.

              <p>
                This was an initial look into real estate sales data from King 
                County, Washington, and the goal was to use the given one year of 
                data to make a price predictor with linear regression.
              </p>
              <p>
                My group (pair) worked to make a model that not only reduced the R-squared 
                value, but also the root mean squared error (RMSE). Our time limit
                was 4 days.
              </p>
              <p>
                We ended up getting a model with a RMSE of ~$130k. Our next steps 
                would be to obtain even more data to improve the model, as we 
                found out that the regression was still underfitting the data, 
                even though we were hybridizing the source data. True to an 
                iterative approach to data science, we will apply our learnings
                to future work and this description and file will be updated 
                should an improvement be devised.

              <!-- <div class="subheading mb-3">How are Soccer Wins Affected by Rain?</div> -->
              <p>
                This was an exploration into a SQL database containing results
                from one year of German soccer matches and combining queries with 
                API calls to see if rain had an affect on these matches.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a solo project and I worked to make visualizations of 
                result (win/loss/tie) percentage for each team in this German league
                and adding another batch of result percentage when rain on the 
                match day was added. The time limit was 1 business day.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to use stacked vertical bar plots for these results.
                While these kinds of plots are contentious visualizations, I felt
                that they were sensical here because each team played the same 
                number of matches and thus it would be very easy to see the result
                percentages for each of the teams in the league.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next steps would be to granularize the weather data even further.
                The MVP only checked for rain on the match day in Berlin, however
                the API could actually check for hourly weather data. In addition,
                not every team in this league plays in Berlin. In order to make 
                these improvements to the model, it will be necessary to consult 
                with soccer experts who know when and where each of the teams 
                played.

              <p>
                This was an exploration into a SQL database containing GPAs from 
                over 10 years of grades at UW Madison to perform hypothesis testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a pair project and we were able to ask and answer 6 
                questions in the time limit of 4 days. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted to see how GPAs were affected by the class meeting day of the week
                (Do GPAs change day to day or weekend to weekday), the class meeting time of day
                (Do GPAs change when the class meets in the morning vs the afternoon),
                the subject material (Do STEM classes have different GPAs from non-STEM ones?),
                possible inflation (Is there a difference between GPAs in 2006/2007 and 2016/2017?),
                yearly inconsistency (Are there any years where the GPAs are different from the others?),
                and instructor inconsistency using one department (In the math department, are there teachers that grade differently from others?).
              </p>
              <p>
                Next steps would be to check for and remove possible data leakage
                and cross validation issues. This dataset is pretty open ended
                and can provide for many questions to ask and attempt to answer.

                This was an exploration into a large CSV from Zillow containing 
                national real estate sales data over 100 years. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This was initially a pair project but had to be adapted to a 
                solo one. The goal was to find the five zipcodes that were best
                to purchase property in. The time limit was 4 days. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This project was very open ended and was a good challenge. The 
                dataset of over 15,000 zipcodes was too large to investigate
                each record effectively and required creative thinking to filter
                down the data into something that could be analyzed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using other resources (economics data and forecasts, Zillow trend
                data, and news reports), I created my own metrics for "best investment"
                and potential housing values. I chose zipcodes with high recent search
                trend activity, consistent pricing trends since the 2008 recession,
                large housing supply, and lower negative mortgage percentage.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be clear, my actual recommendation for a hypothetical client
                with this money to invest was to not spend it on real estate due
                to strong signs for another recession. However, if the client 
                insisted on real estate, these were the options I presented.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next steps would be to compare projections from the model to 
                more recent pricing data and economic reports. In addition, it 
                would be interesting to compare the results from this Facebook 
                Prophet model with individualized ARIMA models.

              <p>
                This was an exploration into a small dataset containing public
                surveys of drug users. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a group project that used simple collaboration. 
                The goal was to find our own data to analyze and to determine 
                the scale of the project ourselves. We decided to use a small 
                dataset and use a variety of classifier methods to have a very
                fast turnaround time of 2 business days for a simple MVP. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This project was open ended and different from the others. We chose
                our constraints to give us more time to work on larger, independent
                projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                For such a fast turnaround time with an open ended project, the results
                seemed satisfactory for exploratory data analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next steps would be to further fine tune a user/business case 
                for the data (hospitals? government? public policy?) in order to
                improve the metrics and deliverables for the classifier models.
